# _Control your computing_

It has never been easier to give away control of your computing experience to
someone else:

- We use software and services that are "free" with strings attached
- We gladly publish valuable data about ourselves online at no cost
- As complexity increases, we understand less of the software we use

Software has touched virtually all human endeavours, so it follows that our
computing experiences have profound impacts on our actual lives.

If we continue to lose control of our digital lives, there may come a tipping
point after which we can never get it back. _1984_ is a good read, but we're not
going to let it become reality!

SaaS (Software as a Service) is a computing paradigm where functionality is no
longer delivered via software that the user installs and manages on their own
hardware, but rather via central web services that users connect to.

This model has undeniable benefits, but it also covertly shifts a significant
amount of power from users to SaaS companies. Some of which take advantage of
their unsuspecting users to yield incredible profits. SaaS enables this
exploitation at a level that simply wasn't possible before.

So SaaS isn't inherently bad, but it enables bad outcomes when mixed with enough
corporate greed. How can we take advantage of the good things SaaS has to offer
while ensuring users are not heading towards an Orwellian digital dystopia?

So welcome to `fossable.org`. This is the home of some free software projects
designed to help us maintain control of our computing. To highlight a few of
them:

- [outpost](https://www.fossable.org/projects/outpost/) is a tunneling
  application that allows you to self-host applications on the public Internet,
  while still having some conveniences of the cloud.

- [sandpolis](https://www.fossable.org/projects/sandpolis/) is a virtual estate
  (basically anything in your digital life) monitoring and management tool.

- [goldboot](https://www.fossable.org/projects/goldboot/) is a tool for building
  and installing customized golden images of your OS.

- [turbine](https://www.fossable.org/projects/turbine/) distributes
  cryptocurrency to contributors of any git repo.

- [gantry](https://www.fossable.org/projects/gantry/) is a "SaaS vending
  machine" that hosts SaaS applications in exchange for cryptocurrency.

Fossable is not a business of any kind. Rather, it's like a _social movement_
with the primary goal of empowering users to **control our computing!**
