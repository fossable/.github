# _Control your computing_

It has never been easier to give away control of your computing experience to
someone else:

- We use software and services that are "free" with strings attached
- We gladly publish valuable data about ourselves at no cost
- As software gets more complex, we understand less of the software we use

Software has touched virtually all human endeavours, so it follows that our
computing experiences have profound impacts on our actual lives.

If we continue to lose control of our digital lives, there may come a tipping
point after which we can never get it back. One of my favorite books is _1984_,
but it's not like I'm interested in bringing it to life in the real world!

## Fossable

So welcome to `fossable.org`. This is the home of some free software projects
designed to help us maintain control of our computing. To name them all:

- [outpost](https://www.fossable.org/projects/outpost/) is a tunneling
  application that allows you to self-host applications on the public Internet,
  while still having some conveniences of the cloud.

- [turbine](https://www.fossable.org/projects/turbine/) is a server that watches
  a git repo of your choice and sends cryptocurrency to contributors.

- [gantry](https://www.fossable.org/projects/gantry/) is a "SaaS vending
  machine" that helps host SaaS applications in exchange for cryptocurrency.

- [sandpolis](https://www.fossable.org/projects/sandpolis/) is a virtual estate
  (basically anything in your digital life) monitoring and management tool.

- [goldboot](https://www.fossable.org/projects/goldboot/) is a tool for building
  and installing customized golden images of your OS.

Fossable is not a business of any kind. Rather, it's like a _social movement_
with the primary goal of empowering users to **control our computing!**
