## **fossable** is an ethos

It's not a business; it's not a foundation; it's not even a legal entity of
any kind. Instead, **fossable** is a group of software projects tied together by a
strong ethos that the best software is an instrument of the user - not the developer.

This principle should extend into the _Software as a Service_ paradigm as well,
but such is not the norm in our current era. The [SaaS Bargain](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Faustian_bargain) offers
irresistable value at the expense of users' freedom and privacy. Most users probably
didn't even notice the power shift that occurred.

But it doesn't have to be that way! **fossable** is about building SaaS that doesn't
forfeit features for freedom, and inspiring others to do the same.
